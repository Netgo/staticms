# StatiCMS
## Everytime you use Wordpress or Joomla for small and static website god kills a kitten.
## Everytime you waste hours trying to fix broken MySQL/UTF8 charset nightmare this kitten gets eaten.

### User uses edit link in page footer. No admin/IT bullshit - only his content.
### Admin uses /_cms_admin  No FTP, no editor, no MySQL  - only code.
